# riso x p5 x Rina

âœ¨ I was learning p5.Js while my friends got an office for their start-up Risograph business. So I thought, can p5 do Riso?
Fortunately, there is an awesome library called [p5.Riso](https://antiboredom.github.io/p5.riso/) created by Sam Lavigne and Tega Brain.

This is a simple experiment on different Dither functions and Riso color palettes. It offers users a way to interact with Riso artwork, as long as get to know the color combination to make the final artwork. 

P/s: I adore Rina Sawayama ðŸ¥º
